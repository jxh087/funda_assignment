# funda_assignment


Dear Funda Data Team,

First of all, many thanks for this opportunity. I am enthusiastic about the chance to demonstrate my skills and potential contribution to your team.

    Regarding the assignment, I have chosen to conduct the analysis using Jupyter Notebook. For a detailed presentation of the results, the "HousingReviews.html" document is available for your perusal.
    
    To review my approach and methodologies, please refer to the "HousingReviews.ipynb" file.

    Should you have any queries or require further clarifications, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
    
    Looking forward to hear from your feedback.
    
Warm regards,

Jason
